# Titan Cache Balance Limiter-LLD is a robust rate limiting solution designed to handle high traffic scenarios with fine-grained control over API request rates.
  Built with a variety of rate limiting algorithms, this project provides flexible and scalable options for managing user requests, preventing abuse, 
  and ensuring system stability.

# Multiple Rate Limiting Algorithms :

* Token Bucket: Allows requests to be handled in bursts and refills tokens over time.
* Leaky Bucket: Ensures a steady flow of requests by enforcing a fixed rate of request processing.
* Fixed Window Counter: Counts requests in fixed time windows and limits based on predefined thresholds.
* Sliding Window Log: Logs timestamps of requests and checks their frequency within a sliding window to allow or deny requests.
* Sliding Window Counter: A hybrid approach combining fixed window and sliding window log techniques to smooth out traffic spikes.
* Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Bucket: Dynamically adjusts rate limits based on moving averages to adapt to varying traffic patterns.
* Burst Rate Limiting: Manages high burst traffic by allowing a temporary capacity to absorb spikes while maintaining overall rate limits.
* Adaptive Rate Limiting: Adjusts rate limits in real-time based on traffic patterns, allowing the system to adapt to changing usage.
* Rate Limiting with Quotas: Sets predefined quotas for different users or services, ensuring fair usage distribution.
* EMABucket Rate Limiting: Utilizes the Exponential Moving Average to smooth out traffic patterns and apply adaptive rate limits.
* Circuit Breaker Rate Limiting: Protects your services from overload by breaking the circuit when the request rate exceeds a safe threshold.

# Project Structure:
  The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

  * Model (titanVault.model): Contains classes representing different rate limiting strategies and configurations, such as EMABucket, LeakyBucket, TokenBucket, and more.

  * Service (titanVault.service): Implements the business logic for rate limiting, including classes like EMABucketRateLimiter, LeakyBucketRateLimiter, BurstRateServiceLimiter, etc.

  * Controller (titanVault.controller): Manages incoming requests and interacts with the service layer to apply rate limiting policies.

  * Test (titanVault.serviceTest): Contains unit tests for rate limiting algorithms with two categories:

    * Small Dataset Tests: Tests with moderate values.
    * Large Dataset Tests: Tests with large values.
